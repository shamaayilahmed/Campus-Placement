Cost Price (CP) : The price at which an article is purchased. This is the cost of the article incurred to the seller in buying the article for re-selling.

Selling Price (SP) : The price at which the article is sold to the customer/buyer.

Marked Price or List Price (MP) : The price mentioned on the article

Profit or Gain (P) : The extra money that the seller gets on selling an article.
P = SP – CP
Profit percent = (P / CP) x 100

Loss (L) : The less money a seller gets on selling an article.
L = CP – SP
Loss percent = (L / CP) x 100

Discount (D) : The reduction in price offered by the seller is called discount.
D = MP – SP
Discount percent = (D / MP) x 100

Profit or Loss is always calculated on the cost price. Discount is calculated on marked price or list price.

If two articles are sold at the same selling price, one at a gain of A% and one at the loss of A%, then the seller always incurs a percentage loss of (A / 10)2.

If a seller claims to sell at cost price but uses false weights, then
Profit percent = [ (True Value – Given Value) / Given Value ] x 100 %

Some tricky problems

Question: A shopkeeper purchased two varieties of rice, 80 KG at Rs. 13.50 per KG and 120 KG at Rs. 16 per KG. The shopkeeper being greedy, mixed the two varieties of rice and
sold the mixture at a gain of 16 %. Find the per KG selling price of the mixture.
Solution : We are given that the shopkeeper bought 80 Kg at Rs. 13.50 per KG and 120 KG at Rs. 16 per KG.
=> Total cost price = (80 x 13.50) + (120 x 16) = 1080 + 1920 = Rs. 3000 and total rice = 80 + 120 = 200 KG
Now, total selling price = Total cost price + 16 % of total cost price
=> Total selling price = 3000 + (0.16 x 3000) = Rs. 3480
Thus, selling price per KG = 3480 / 200 = Rs. 17.40

Question: A dealer wants to mark the price of an article such that on offering a 5 % discount, he is able to get 33 % profit. Find the percent of CP above which the article 
should be marked.
Solution : Let the cost price of the article be Rs. 100
=> Selling price of the article = Rs. 100 + 33% of CP = Rs. 133
Let the marked price be Rs. M
=> Selling price = Marked Price – Discount
=> 133 = M – 0.05 M
=> 133 = 0.95 M
=> M = 140
=> M – CP = 140 – 100 = 40
Therefore, percent of CP above which the article should be marked = (40 / 100) x 100 = 40 %
