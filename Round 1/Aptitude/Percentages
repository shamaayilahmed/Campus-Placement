To convert a fraction to percentage, we multiply by 100 and add the “%” sign. For example, to express 1 / 5 in percentage, we simply multiply by 100, (1 / 5) x 100 = 20 %
To convert a percentage to fraction, we simply divide by 100. For example, 25 % = 25 / 100 = 1 / 4
Expenditure = Price x Consumption
If price of an article increases by P %, the necessary reduction in consumption to avoid increase in expenditure = [( P / (100 + P) ) x 100] %
If price of an article decreases by P %, the necessary increase in consumption to keep the same expenditure = [( P / (100 – P) ) x 100] %
Population : If the population of a group/community/country/place(etc.) is currently P and if it increases by R % every year, then :
Population after ‘n’ years = P x [1 + (R / 100)]n
Population before ‘n’ years = P / [1 + (R / 100)]n
Depreciation : If the price (or value) of an article is currently P and if it depreciates by R % every year, then:
Price (or value) after ‘n’ years = P x [1 – (R / 100)]n
Price (or value) before ‘n’ years = P / [1 – (R / 100)]n
x % of y and y % of x are same. For example, 10 % of 100 and 100 % of 10 are same.
A successive increase of a% and b% is equivalent to a net increase of a + b + ((a x b) / 100) %
A successive decrease of a% and b% is equivalent to a net decrease of a + b – ((a x b) / 100) %
An increase by n % and a successive decrease by n % is equal to an equivalent decrease of (n/10)2 %. For example, if the price of an article is increased by 10 %, and is then 
successively decreased by 10 %, then this is equal to a decrease of (10/10)2 = 1 %

## Problems

Question: 25 % of a number is 8 less than one third of that number. Find the number.
Solution : Let the number be n.
=> (n / 3) – 25 % of n = 8
=> (n / 3) – (n / 4) = 8
=> n / 12 = 8
=> n = 96
Thus, 96 is the required number.

Question : How much sugar (in KG) must be added to 50 KG of a 2 % sugar solution so as to make the concentration 10 % ?
Solution : Sugar in initial solution = 2 % of 50 KG = 1 KG
Let the sugar added be n KG.
=> (1 + n) / (50 + n) = 10 / 100
=> n = 40 / 9
Therefore, 40 / 9 KG of sugar should be added.
