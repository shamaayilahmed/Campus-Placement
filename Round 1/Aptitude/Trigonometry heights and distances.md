sin θ = Perpendicular / Hypotenuse
cos θ = Base / Hypotenuse
tan θ = Perpendicular / Base
In the first quadrant, all trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec, cot) are positive.
In second quadrant, only sin and cosec are positive.
In third quadrant, only tan and cot are positive.
In fourth quadrant, only cos and sec are positive.
sin2θ + cos2θ = 1
1 + tan2θ = sec2θ
1 + cot2θ = cosec2θ
sin(- θ) = – sin θ
cos(- θ) = cos θ
tan(- θ) = – tan θ
cosec(- θ) = – cosec θ
sec(- θ) = sec θ
cot(- θ) = – cot θ


Height = Distance moved / [cot(original angle) – cot(final angle)]
=> h = d / (cot θ1 – cot θ2)

Question : There are two poles, one on each side of the road. The higher pole is 54 m high. From the top of this pole, the angle of depression of top and bottom of 
the shorter pole is 30 and 60 degree respectively. Find the height of the shorter pole.

Solution :
Let AB and CD be the two poles.
Let AC = x m and CD = h m
Now, in triangle ABC,
tan 60 = AB / AC
=> \sqrt{3} = 54 / AC
=> AC = 18 \sqrt{3} m
Clearly, AC = DE = 18 \sqrt{3} m
In triangle BED,
tan 30 = BE / DE
=> BE = DE tan 30
=> BE = 18 \sqrt{3} / \sqrt{3} m
=> BE = 18 m
=> CD = AE = AB – BE
=> CD = 54 – 18 = 36 m
Therefore, height of the shorter pole = 36 m
