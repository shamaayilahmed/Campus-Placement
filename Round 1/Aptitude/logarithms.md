Logarithmic function is the inverse to the exponential function. A logarithm to the base b is the power to which b must be raised to produce a given number. For example,
\log_2 8 is equal to the power to which 2 must be raised to in order to produce 8. Clearly, 2^3 = 8 so \log_2 8 = 3. In general, for b > 0 and b not equal to 1.

Question : log2(33 – 3x)= 10log(5 – x). Solve for x.
Solution: Put x = 0
log2(33 – 1)= 10log(5)
log232 = 5
5 log2 2 = 5
5 = 5
LHS = RHS

Question : Find (121/10)x = 3
Solution: Apply logarithm on both sides
log(121/10)(121/10)x = log(121/10)3
x = (log 3) / (log 121 – log 10)
x = (log 3) / (2 log 11 – 1)

Question : Solve the equation log121728 x log96561
Solution: It can be written as
log12(123) x log9(94)
= 3log1212 x 4log99
= 3 x 4 = 12
