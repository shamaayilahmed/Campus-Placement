IMPORTANT AREAS

1. If a person can do a piece of work in ‘n’ days, then in one day, the person will do ‘1/n’ work. Conversely, if the person does ‘1/n’ work in one day, the person will require ‘n’
days to finish the work.

2. ** In questions where there is a comparison of work and efficiency, we use the formula
M1 D1 H1 E1 / W1 = M2 D2 H2 E2 / W2, where
M = Number of workers
D = Number of days
H = Number of working hours in a day
E = Efficiency of workers
W = Units of work

3. In case we have more than one type of workers, then the formula modifies to
∑(Mi Ei) D1 H1 / W1 = ∑(Mj Ej) D2 H2 / W2, where ‘i’ and ‘j’ may vary as per the number of workers.

4. If a person A is ‘n’ times more efficient than person B, then
Ratio of work done by A and B in one day (Ratio of efficiencies) = n : 1
Ratio of time taken by A and B = 1 : n

5. *** Total work = No. of Days x Efficiency

6. If a group of people are given salary for a job they do together, their individual salaries are in the ratio of their individual efficiencies if they work for same number of 
days. Otherwise, salaries are divided in the ratio of units of work done.

7. ** If A alone can do a work in x days, and B alone can do in y days Total work=LCM(x,y)

SOME TRICKY PROBLEMS

Q If 6 men and 8 boys can do a piece of work in 10 days while 26 men and 48 boys can do the same in 2 days, the time taken by 15 men and 20 boys in doing the same type of work will be:
ans Let the amount of work 1 man can do in 1 day be x and the amount of work 1 boys can do in 1 day be y. Then, 6x + 8y = 1/10 and 26x + 48y = ½. Solving these two equations, 
    we get: x = 1/100 and y = 1/200. Amount of work done by 15 men and 20 boys in 1 day = 15/100 + 20/200 = ¼. Therefore, the answer is 4 days
    
Q 3 men and 4 women can complete a work in 10 days by working 12 hours a day. 13 men and 24 women can do the same work by working same hours a day in 2 days. How much time would
12 men and 1 women working same hours a day will take to complete the whole work?
ans Here, we need to apply the formula ∑(Mi Ei) D1 H1 / W1 = ∑(Mj Ej) D2 H2 / W2, where ∑(Mi Ei) = (3 x m) + (4 x w) ∑(Mj Ej) = (13 x m) + (24 x w), where 'm' is the efficiency
of each man and 'w' is the efficiency of each woman D1 = 10 days D2 = 2 days H1 = 12 hours H2 = 12 hours W1 = W2 = Work to be done   
So, we have (3m + 4w) x 10 x 12 = (13m + 24w) x 2 x 12 => 15m + 20w = 13m + 24w => 2m = 4w => m = 2w => m : w = 2 : 1 Therefore, ratio of efficiency of man and woman = 2 : 1 
If the constant of proportionality be 'k', Efficiency of each man = m = 2k Efficiency of each woman = w = k   Now, we re-apply the same formula.
∑(Mi Ei) D1 H1 / W1 = ∑(Mj Ej) D2 H2 / W2, where ∑(Mi Ei) = (3 x m) + (4 x w) ∑(Mj Ej) = (12 x m) + (1 x w) D1 = 10 days D2 = Days requires by 12 men and 1 woman H1 = 12 hours 
H2 = 12 hours W1 = W2 = Work to be done   So, we have (3m + 4w) x 10 x 12 = (12m + w) x D2 x 12 => 30m + 40w = (12m + w) x D2 => 60k + 40k = (24k + k) x D2 => 100k = 25k x D2 => D2 = 4 
Therefore, 12 men and 1 woman would require 4 days to complete the work.
